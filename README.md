## Website Choice

For this assignment, I chose to do the IKEA website (https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/). I recreared the homepage, and wishlist page (https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/favourites/). The wishlist page style on the IKEA website can be seen after adding a few items into it.

I decided to recreate those two pages, as I felt the homepage had many opportunities to show the use of props and components, while the wishlist page was just something I found unique.

The components I created are: 
- Navbar
- Footer
- Homepage
- Wishlist Page
- Wishlist Item
- Button
- Big Promotion
- Long Promotion

## Reason for Components

I had two components that were not reusable which were the pages. The other components were all made so they could be reused. Navbar and Footer always appear the same on all pages; however Button, Wishlist Item, Big Promotion, and Long Promotion are all components that can be reused and configurable. This makes styling and consistency much easier since these are used many times.
